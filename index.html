<h1>Peter Uchytil's Portfolio and Blog</h1>
<p>Hi. I'm a UX Designer currently looking for a job. I've always had corporate jobs, not freelance, so I never spent time building up a portfolio. The examples of larger projects are internal to the companies I worked for, so I am highlighting some instances of design problems I have from my notes. Hopefully these examples illustrate my approach.</p>
<p>I will also write some regular blog articles on design and document some of my own projects to further illustrate my design skills. I hope you find something interesting here.</p>
