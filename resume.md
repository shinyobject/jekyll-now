#### Employment History

##### DAT Solutions - March 2012-September 2017

###### Senior Lead UX Interaction Designer
DAT is the industry leader in freight matching and rate forecasting for the trucking industry.

###### Lead UX Interaction Designer

I transitioned from being an associate Interaction Designer to being the lead after about a year. I worked on the company’s flagship freight matching product, DAT Power. This was a new web-based product redesigned from a Windows-based product. Moving from a native client to a web application introduced many constraints which required new solutions. After this project I worked on the company’s iOS and Android freight matching products. Again, new constraints which required new designs. A lot of data needed to be shown in a small space. My final project was to rebuild the low-end freight matching product using Material Design. In these roles, I was responsible for conceptual design of features, helping product owners refine their vision, and wireframes and prototypes to hand off to visual design and development. Basically my job was to quickly iterate on ideas, be they mine or someone else’s, to evaluate and select the best, most feasible options before committing development resources. 

##### Site 9 - January 2007-January 2012

Site9 is a venture-funded startup. The product began as a content management system for e‑commerce websites and evolved into ProtoShare.com, an online, collaborative website prototyping tool targeted towards the UX Design and Information Architecture spaces. Being a startup, the team was small, so I had oversight across multiple departments. 

###### Senior Web Developer

Used Site9‘s CMS to develop client websites which involved extensive hand-coding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Responsible for designing and maintaining the corporate ProtoShare.com websites (main site, blog, forum). This entailed hand-coding HTML, CSS and JavaScript, designing layout, graphics, forms, video and content. Produced the product tour video in-house instead of outsourcing it, saving$10,000 over two years (which equates to about 10% of Marketing’s monthly budget). Contributed various icons and graphics and CSS expertise to the ProtoShare application.

###### Product Marketing Manager

Responsible for strategic messaging for ProtoShare.com. Duties included preforming competitive market research of the UX community, formulating pricing strategies, evaluating application usability, and providing real world customer-focused feedback (because I was using our product to do actual UX design of our websites) on product direction. Developed marketing materials including blog posts, videos, graphics, release notes, and example content for inclusion with the ProtoShare.com application. Tracked and reported on application stats. Conducted ongoing product testing, verifying user issues, and defect analysis and reporting.

###### Salesforce.com Developer/Administrator

Planned and managed initial roll out for the sales team. Worked with Engineering on back-end integration with ProtoShare.com using Apex for reporting on sign-up and billing functions. One highlight was using Salesforce.com email handlers to respond to ProtoShare.com application events such as new and cancelled accounts, freeing up value Engineering resources. Developed a custom VisualForce sales dashboard using SOQL queries and HTML/JavaScript which tracked many variables regarding trials and customers, keeping everyone on the same page.


##### Kentrox - 1990-2006

###### Salesforce.com Administrator & Senior Web Developer - 2001-2006

As the primary Salesforce.com system administrator, led a cross-departmental team of three other administrators. Was the go-to person for technical problems and research. Integrated legacy databases and did customization work where needed. 

Managed multiple websites, internal, external and partner. Produced specialty marketing campaigns, including a highly regarded custom Excel-based product configurator and weekly activity newsletter for the sales team. Designed the first web-based UI for Kentrox’s router products. Did product photography for web and print.

###### Web Developer - 1996-2001

Developed Kentrox’s first website as a side project in 1994. Transitioned to full time management of a four person web team in 1996. During this time Kentrox launched a B-to-B eCommerce site and grew the web site from a simple product site to one including support and partner portals. Responsible for training new employees in web technologies.

###### Information Engineer - 1994-1996

Specialist in the Technical Publications department responsible for documenting complex network management products. Received outstanding work award for my innovate documentation solution for network management software and comprehensive 300+ page reference materials.

###### Software Engineer - 1990-1994

Developed network management software, specifically responsible for a middle-ware PC-based application which translated between device command-line interfaces and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
